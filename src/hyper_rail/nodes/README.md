# Nodes

Driven by the roscore to communicate between all parts of the ROS structure
Files here should be left without file extensions as it looks cleaner, and they require a shebang line at the beginning (#!/usr/bin/env python3)

Note to CS467 grader: CameraMock, LocationTester, LocationTracker, PathInputTester, PathPlanner, PositionTester nodes in development. Related topics and services used by the nodes are located in ../srv and ../msg
